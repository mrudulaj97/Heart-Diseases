# Heart-Diseases
##Introduction
Cardio and vascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality in the world. 
Although most people know that the heart must be properly cared for, heart diseases had risen steadily over the last century and has become the leading cause of death for people in the United States.
It is predicted that the number of annual deaths will rise to 25 million people by 2030. Medical diagnosis is an important yet complicated task that needs to be executed accurately and efficiently. 
Heart disease classification systems can help detect anomalies in the patientâ€™s readings and warn the doctors. Association rule mining and classification are two major techniques of data mining.
##What is Association rule mining?
Association rule mining is an unsupervised learning method for discovering interesting patterns and their association in large data bases. 
Whereas classification is a supervised learning method used to find class label for unknown sample.
A lot of focus is been devoted towards classification of the heart condition but a very little research is been done towards identifying the risk factors of individual patients and finding the association between the parameters. 
This research is aimed as improving the classification accuracy while analyzing the associated risk factors.
